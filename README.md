# Personal_Website
My own Personal Website

Hello,

This is supposed to be my personal website. I was able to do this thanks to the people at [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) who made the icons i used, as well at the people at [Docker-Curriculum](https://docker-curriculum.com/) who helped me learn the basics of Docker, and who showed me the flask app that i'm using to serve this website.

You can put the website up and running using a docker container by simply using:

docker run -p 8888:5000 tmdias/website

Alternatively, if you wish to make changes to the website, simply download this github project, make the required changes and build your own docker image (if you don't know how to do that, just have a look at docker-curriculum.com for the basics)

If you have any suggestions or bugs, feel free to let me know, or better yet, make a pull request!

Cheers!
